## BevCie
A class with functions and constants used mainly in photometric, colorimetric and radiometric applications. 

## RandomUtil
A small static class to provide functions for uniform and normal distributed pseudo random numbers. No need for instantiating like the .NET Random class.

## SpectralQuantity
A collection of `SpectralQuantityValue`. Provides some methods for interpolation, loading from CSV files and randomisation for Monte Carlo simulations.

## SpectralQuantityValue
Ordered pair of a wavelength value and an associated spectral quantity value. Can be sorted via the wavelength value.
